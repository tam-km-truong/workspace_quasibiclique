  Below is how my matrix is declared. 
  
      ----------
    rows_data: list of tuples (row, degree) of rows in the matrix.
    cols_data: list of tuples (col, degree) of columns in the matrix.
    edges: list of tuples (row, col) corresponding to the ones of the matrix.
    
    I know a matrix M with rows_data, cols_data and edges
    and a submatrix of M called sub_M with rows_res, cols_res; edges_res. 
    
   can you write me a python code that returns two submatrices M1 and M2 such that 
   M1 with rows_new =rows_data minus rows_res and  cols_new = cols_data and edges_new respectively computed to take in account the modifications
   and 
   M2 with rows_new= rows_data and cols_new =   cols_data - cols_res and edges_new respectively computed  to take in account the modifications
